Aergia
=========

Aergia is my own pygame engine. Updated every now and then, I try to make it useful for quicker dev time.

## Version
Current Version: v0.0.2a

### v0.0.1
- Save/Load system
- Neon effect (basic)
- RessourceLoader to load & cache ressources
- Global Var (like color)
- App() to quickstart development process & handle game
